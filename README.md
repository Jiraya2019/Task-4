#On Day 2, requirement analysis was carried out to identify the functional and non-functional requirements of the Online Examination System. Functional requirements included user registration and login, admin management of students and question banks, exam creation, conducting online tests, automatic evaluation, and result generation. User roles were clearly defined, mainly Admin and Student, where the admin is responsible for managing exams, questions, and users, and the student is responsible for taking exams and viewing results. Non-functional requirements such as system security, reliability, performance, scalability, anduree user-friendly interface were also analyzed. This phase helped in understanding system expectations and ensured that all necessary features were planned before implementation.
